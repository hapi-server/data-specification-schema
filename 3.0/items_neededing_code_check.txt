things that require code checking:
1. In the capabilities endpoint, the JSON schema requires at least one item for outputFormats,
but the schema cannot enforce that this item be the "csv" item.

2. general issue:  duplicate keys in JSON objects are not detected by all parsers - "the last
one wins" is usually what parses do if they don't throw an error, so we should try and detect
duplicate entries within an object and point this out as an error
